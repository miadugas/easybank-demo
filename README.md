# easybank-demo

The EasyBank Demo is a modern, responsive banking website showcasing financial services with a clean user interface. Built with Vue 3 and TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for efficient styling. The site provides a potential user experience for a new digital banking platform. Its purpose is to provide a proof of concept for a sleek and intuitive financial service interface suitable for modern users. Includes a fully functioning blog platform, privacy policy and careers section.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration
